# @summary Registers a local Nginx TLS certificate and key check.
#
# Requires the nginx class and the File resource supplied by config_file. The normal caller is nginx::server, which
# registers separate main and redirect checks and supplies its own configuration path. This helper never includes
# monitoring classes or creates executable copies. The nginx class owns one shared root-owned 0700 check_nginx_cert
# script and its runtime package dependencies through basic_settings::monitoring_custom. This
# helper passes safely escaped server names, the configuration file and check settings as arguments.
# The script uses nginx -T with nginx::config_file and the binary default prefix, discovers paths at runtime and
# validates against self-issued roots from the Debian/Ubuntu system trust bundle. Custom service command-line overrides
# are outside this module contract. Install internal root CAs through the system trust mechanism.
# ssl_trusted_certificate is inspected separately and never supplies missing offered intermediates or trust anchors.
# Concrete DNS aliases are checked; Nginx wildcard/regex names, dynamic paths and encrypted keys are UNKNOWN. Nothing
# renews certificates, reloads Nginx or verifies a live endpoint. Root access is required under the existing agent
# sandbox; private keys remain private and certificates beneath protected home directories are unassessable.
# Automatic vhost checks follow nginx::server lifecycle, including ensure => absent and monitoring_cert => false. The
# shared concat registry removes retired registrations on every apply, including deleted declarations; no per-vhost
# executable remains to clean up. The shared script follows the nginx class monitoring state. Keep
# basic_settings::monitoring declared with package => none during backend retirement.
#
# @example Monitor an explicitly managed vhost
#   include nginx
#   nginx::server { 'app': server_name => 'app.example.org', monitoring_cert => false }
#
#   # Register the explicitly managed vhost against the shared certificate check.
#   nginx::monitoring_cert { 'app/external':
#     config_file => '/etc/nginx/conf.d/app.conf',
#     server_name => 'app.example.org',
#     require     => Nginx::Server['app'],
#   }
#
# @param config_file
#   Absolute path supplied by the owner of the target File resource; distinguishes vhosts with identical server names.
#
# @param detail_limit
#   Optional diagnostic character limit before the always-visible Interpretation section. `undef` omits -l and uses the
#   environment value or script default.
#
# @param ensure
#   `present` registers only with an active monitoring backend; `absent` removes the registration while preserving the
#   shared executable.
#
# @param interval
#   Agent execution interval in seconds. The default is 300; every active vhost check runs nginx -T once per interval.
#
# @param registration_name
#   Readable identity between check_nginx_ and _cert; undef uses the resource title. Characters other than ASCII
#   letters, digits, underscores and hyphens become underscores. Names must remain unique on the host after
#   normalization; collisions fail catalog compilation. nginx::server supplies the first main server_name followed by
#   /main or /redirect, falling back to its title when server_name is empty. This identity only labels the registration
#   and never replaces the server_name argument used for certificate validation.
#
# @param server_name
#   Actual server_name directive input, separate from the title. `undef` or empty input produces UNKNOWN without a title
#   fallback.
#
# @param timeout
#   Optional timeout override in seconds for both script and agent. `undef` omits -t and uses the script environment
#   value or default, while the agent uses monitoring_custom's default. The script reserves three seconds for
#   termination and output and kills remaining children.
#
# @param validity_critical
#   Optional critical validity threshold in days. `undef` omits -c and uses the environment value or script default. The
#   minimum remaining validity must be strictly below the threshold to trigger it. Must be below the effective warning
#   threshold; the script validates combinations with omitted values.
#
# @param validity_warning
#   Optional warning validity threshold in days. `undef` omits -w and uses the environment value or script default.
#   Remaining validity must be strictly below the threshold to trigger it. Must exceed the effective critical threshold;
#   the script validates combinations with omitted values. Expired/not-yet-valid certificates are always critical.
