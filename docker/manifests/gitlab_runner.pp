# @summary Deploys a GitLab Runner Compose manager with optional one-time registration.
#
# Declare `docker` and `basic_settings::systemd` first, with Docker's APT source available.
# The title is the Compose project name; private state lives in `/opt/docker/<title>/config`.
# Puppet manages the directory entry, never the contents of `config.toml` or `.runner_system_id`.
# Registration uses docker::compose_exec in the running Compose container; an existing config.toml prevents another
# registration.
# Existing configuration is not parsed or repaired; validate a failed or interrupted registration manually before
# retrying Puppet.
# Use a dedicated host or VM for trusted builds: the manager's Docker socket grants host-level access.
# New registrations use the host daemon for unprivileged job containers, `alpine:latest` and the `if-not-present` pull
# policy.
# Manager mounts and runner_ip are not inherited by job containers; existing executor configuration remains unmanaged.
# The manager bind-mounts the root-owned 0700 config directory and the host socket; the bootstrap token is outside both
# mounts.
# The Docker executor creates separate build, helper and service containers; inspect their actual volumes and
# privileges.
# Check the effective DOCKER_HOST and runners.docker.host before relying on the host-daemon configuration.
# The fixed if-not-present policy can reuse cached private images without fresh registry authorization; restrict runner
# access.
# See the dedicated Runner node in `examples/docker.pp` for host setup, registration and validation steps.
#
# @example Deploy an already registered runner without retaining a bootstrap secret
#   include docker
#   include basic_settings::systemd
#
#   # Preserve a manually prepared registration in the private project config directory.
#   docker::gitlab_runner { 'gitlab-runner':
#     require => Class['docker'],
#   }
#
# @param auto_register
#   Defaults to false. When true, run registration only while config.toml is absent; existing files require manual
#   validation.
#   The local existence guard has no registration side effects during noop, but also skips empty, damaged or partial
#   files.
#   After failure, pause Puppet runs and inspect local state and the GitLab runner manager through a protected admin
#   session.
#   A timeout can leave registration running inside the container; check the process before attempting recovery.
#   Restore config.toml and .runner_system_id together, or reconcile the GitLab registration before deliberately
#   removing state.
#   Never delete config.toml just to force a retry; keep one Puppet agent responsible and avoid concurrent manual
#   registration.
#   When false, prepare an existing registration or register manually before using the runner.
#
# @param ensure
#   Defaults to present. Absent uses Compose's directory removal; stop and detach the stack yourself before deleting
#   local state.
#   Pause the runner and drain jobs before maintenance; SIGQUIT has 240 seconds of Compose grace within a 300-second
#   systemd stop.
#   Before removal, back up required data, detach the systemd target binding, reload systemd and stop the stack with its
#   files intact.
#   Retire the systemd service and GitLab registration separately; absent does neither and does not remove Docker named
#   volumes.
#   Deleting the project directory loses its bootstrap token, runtime token, system identity and project-local
#   bind-mount data.
#
# @param image_tag
#   Runner manager and registration image tag as a String, default latest. Tag syntax and availability are checked by
#   Docker.
#   The exact tag latest selects `docker::compose` pull always on each Compose service start. Other tags select pull
#   missing to download an uncached image. See `docker::compose` pull for failure and update behavior.
#   This policy affects the manager image; the executor job image pull policy is unchanged.
#   Line breaks are rejected because this value is written to a single .env entry.
#   Replacing the manager preserves its mounted registration; it does not change existing executor settings or register
#   again.
#
# @param monitoring_detail_limit
#   Compose check diagnostic character limit, default 6000; passed unchanged to `docker::compose`.
#
# @param monitoring_expected_exited
#   Container names allowed to exit, default empty; passed unchanged to `docker::compose`.
#
# @param monitoring_health_required
#   Container names requiring Docker health state, default empty; passed unchanged to `docker::compose`.
#
# @param monitoring_interval
#   Compose monitoring interval in seconds, default 300.
#
# @param monitoring_orphan_critical
#   Treat orphan containers as critical, default false.
#
# @param monitoring_profiles
#   Compose profiles for monitoring, default empty.
#
# @param monitoring_starting_grace
#   Compose startup grace period in seconds, default 300.
#
# @param monitoring_timeout
#   Compose monitoring timeout in seconds, default 60.
#
# @param runner_description
#   Local runner name used at registration and by validation, default docker-runner; no control characters.
#
# @param runner_ip
#   Optional IPv4 or IPv6 address without a subnet, default undef. Undef or an empty string retains normal DNS
#   resolution.
#   Compose maps the hostname parsed from runner_url with Puppet's native URI type, including registration inside the
#   manager.
#   Does not change the URL, TLS verification or Docker executor job containers.
#   Requires Compose 2.24.1 or later for the HOST:IP form; omit subnet prefixes and IPv6 brackets.
#   If GitLab is reachable only through this mapping, helper checkout and artifact upload can fail after registration
#   succeeds.
#   Provide DNS reachable from each container network, or merge extra_hosts into the existing runner's runners.docker
#   table.
#   For example: extra_hosts = ["gitlab.example.org:192.0.2.50"]. Preserve other entries, runtime tokens and system
#   identity.
#   Apply that executor setting after first registration or while an existing runner is paused with jobs drained.
#   Puppet does not reconcile it when runner_ip changes; review manager, helper and job DNS/TLS plus host-daemon
#   registry access.
#   Removing the mapping restores normal manager DNS; mapping changes refresh the manager, so pause and drain jobs
#   first.
#
# @param runner_token
#   Optional Sensitive runner authentication token, default undef; only required on the host for a new automatic
#   registration.
#   Undef removes the bootstrap file without changing the runtime token; remove the profile's mandatory lookup too.
#   Use an authentication token from a runner created in GitLab, not a legacy registration token; set access and tags in
#   GitLab.
#   The private bootstrap file is fed through stdin to CI_SERVER_TOKEN; no terminal is allocated and registration output
#   is discarded.
#   Sensitive protects normal output but does not encrypt every catalog/cache or hide secrets from host and Docker
#   administrators.
#
# @param runner_url
#   GitLab instance HTTPS URL, default https://gitlab.com/; credentials, query strings and fragments are rejected.
#   Existing registration URLs are not rewritten; keep this value consistent with the active config.toml.
#
# @param target
#   Existing systemd target suffix for this Compose stack, default services; passed unchanged to `docker::compose`.
