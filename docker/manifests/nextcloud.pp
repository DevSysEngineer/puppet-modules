# @summary Deploys the bundled Nextcloud All-in-One (AIO) Docker Compose stack.
#
# This defined type deploys only the AIO mastercontainer through docker::compose. AIO creates and owns its sibling
# containers through the Docker socket, including Apache and the database. Compose prepares the private host
# directory /opt/docker/<title>/backup; select that host path in AIO to use it for local backups. AIO configures
# its Borg backup container itself, without a backup mount or environment setting in the mastercontainer.
# Declare docker first; basic_settings::systemd is needed to start the stack through the shared Compose service.
# The resource title names the managed Compose project. AIO's fixed container and volume names allow only ONE AIO
# installation per Docker daemon, regardless of that title or the chosen ports. Multiple installations require
# separate VMs or Docker daemons, as documented in
# https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/blob/main/multiple-instances.md.
# This wrapper uses the local rootful Docker daemon. Compose monitoring covers the mastercontainer only.
#
# The application upstream is HTTP on loopback because APACHE_PORT enables AIO's external reverse-proxy mode.
# The admin upstream remains self-signed HTTPS on loopback. Optional server_name and admin_server_name publish these
# endpoints through the shared docker::proxy configuration, with docker::compose_proxy owning the application stack.
# Public endpoints require a certificate and key; the certificate must cover every configured public name.
# Without an admin vhost, use an SSH tunnel to the local admin_port to access the admin interface over HTTPS.
# Configure the application domain in AIO after providing its HTTPS reverse proxy; domain validation stays enabled.
# Without server_name, the deployment must provide that HTTPS proxy separately on the same host.
#
# Present stacks always apply this deployment's global OCC defaults (`allow_local_remote_servers`, `default_quota`,
# `default_language`, `default_locale`, `default_phone_region`, `default_app`, `files_max_chunk_size`,
# `skeleton_directory`) through
# `docker::nextcloud_occ`. Puppet only writes on an actual difference. These settings are always managed, with
# configurable values. SMTP and objectstore selections have optional parameters below; use `docker::nextcloud_occ`
# for other settings.
# Until AIO initialization completes, these resources are skipped without writing configuration. Finish setup through
# the admin UI; the first Puppet run with a successful installation check applies any differing settings.
#
# Optional objectstore selections use the same guarded OCC path. Referenced stores must already exist or be declared
# with docker::nextcloud_s3 and ensure present for this deployment; matching registrations run before selection.
# Selecting primary object storage does not migrate existing files; prepare storage migration and backups first.
#
# SMTP shares docker::authentik's parameter names, relay fallback and Sensitive password contract. A resolved relay
# manages mail_smtpmode, mail_smtphost, mail_smtpsecure and boolean mail_smtpauth. Port, timeout, sender and credentials
# are only written when supplied. Omitting these optional values does not remove previously stored values, but
# omitting credentials disables authentication. All mail settings use docker::nextcloud_occ with typed JSON guards;
# no config.php content is managed directly. Nextcloud supports implicit SSL or automatic STARTTLS, not enforced
# STARTTLS; tls is rejected. See
# https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/configuration_server/email_configuration.html.
#
# @example Deploy Nextcloud AIO behind Nginx with both endpoints published
#   include basic_settings
#
#   # Install the runtime after declaring the shared host integration.
#   class { 'docker': }
#
#   # Provide the webserver used by the public endpoints.
#   class { 'nginx': }
#
#   # The certificate must include both cloud.example.org and cloud-admin.example.org.
#   docker::nextcloud { 'nextcloud':
#     server_name         => 'cloud.example.org',
#     admin_server_name   => 'cloud-admin.example.org',
#     admin_whitelist_ips => ['192.0.2.10', '2001:db8::/32'],
#     smtp_server         => 'smtp.example.org',
#     ssl_certificate     => '/etc/letsencrypt/live/cloud.example.org/fullchain.pem',
#     ssl_certificate_key => '/etc/letsencrypt/live/cloud.example.org/privkey.pem',
#   }
#
# @param admin_port
#   Local host port bound to the mastercontainer's HTTPS admin UI on 127.0.0.1. Defaults to 8080 and is written as
#   AIO_ADMIN_PORT. Nginx uses the same upstream port when admin_server_name is set. Must differ from port;
#   ports 80 and 443 are unavailable when either Nginx proxy is enabled. The container's own port remains 8080.
#
# @param admin_server_name
#   Optional public Nginx `server_name` for the AIO admin UI. When set, creates an HTTPS vhost on the standard Nginx
#   listeners with upstream `https://127.0.0.1:<admin_port>`. When unset, access remains local or through an SSH tunnel.
#
# @param admin_whitelist_ips
#   IPv4/IPv6 addresses or CIDR networks allowed through the admin vhost when admin_server_name is set. A nonempty
#   list adds allow rules followed by deny all at server level. Defaults to []; an empty list leaves access
#   unrestricted.
#   Uses the client address seen by Nginx. Does not restrict the application vhost or direct access to admin_port.
#
# @param allow_local_remote_servers
#   Allows requests to remote servers with local addresses, such as federated shares and webcal services, when true.
#   Defaults to false, retaining Nextcloud's restriction on these requests. Enable only for required local integrations.
#   Written through OCC `config:system:set allow_local_remote_servers` with `--type=boolean`.
#
# @param default_app
#   Global default app written through OCC `config:system:set defaultapp`.
#
# @param default_language
#   Global default language written through OCC `config:system:set default_language`.
#
# @param default_locale
#   Global default locale written through OCC `config:system:set default_locale`.
#
# @param default_phone_region
#   Global default phone region written through OCC `config:system:set default_phone_region`.
#
# @param default_quota
#   Global default storage quota written through OCC `config:app:set files default_quota`.
#
# @param ensure
#   Defaults to present. Delegates project lifecycle to `docker::compose`. Stop the AIO sibling containers through
#   the admin UI before stopping the mastercontainer and follow the Compose removal contract. Absent removes the
#   project directory, including its local backup directory; preserve backups elsewhere first. AIO volumes remain.
#
# @param files_max_chunk_size
#   Maximum upload chunk size in bytes, written through OCC `config:app:set files max_chunk_size`.
#   Defaults to 10485760 (10 MiB); 0 disables chunking.
#
# @param image_tag
#   Docker image tag for the mastercontainer, written as `NEXTCLOUD_TAG`. Defaults to `latest`, matching upstream AIO
#   guidance not to pin the mastercontainer image; AIO manages the versions of the containers it spawns separately.
#
# @param monitoring_detail_limit
#   Maximum number of diagnostic characters emitted before the Compose monitoring `Interpretation:` section.
#
# @param monitoring_expected_exited
#   Container names that are allowed to be exited without making the stack critical, such as one-shot migration
#   containers.
#
# @param monitoring_health_required
#   Container names that must have a healthy Docker health state.
#
# @param monitoring_interval
#   Monitoring interval in seconds for the Compose stack check.
#
# @param monitoring_orphan_critical
#   Treats orphaned Compose containers as critical when `true`.
#
# @param monitoring_profiles
#   Compose profiles passed to the monitoring check.
#
# @param monitoring_starting_grace
#   Grace period in seconds before starting containers are considered a problem.
#
# @param monitoring_timeout
#   Timeout in seconds for the Compose stack monitoring check.
#
# @param objectstore_default
#   Named primary objectstore for newly created users, written through OCC `config:system:set objectstore default`.
#   Defaults to undef, leaving the stored selection unmanaged, including when a previously supplied value is omitted.
#   Existing users retain their store mapping; changing this value does not migrate their files.
#
# @param objectstore_root
#   Named primary objectstore for files outside user storage, written through OCC `config:system:set objectstore root`.
#   Defaults to undef, leaving the stored selection unmanaged, including when a previously supplied value is omitted.
#   Nextcloud uses objectstore default when no root selection is stored. Changing this value does not migrate files.
#
# @param port
#   Local HTTP upstream port written as APACHE_PORT and used by Nginx. Defaults to 11000 and binds to 127.0.0.1.
#   Port 443 selects AIO's integrated HTTPS mode and is not supported here. Must differ from admin_port;
#   port 80 is also unavailable when either Nginx proxy is enabled.
#
# @param server_name
#   Optional public hostname for Nextcloud; defaults to undef. Configure this same domain in the AIO interface.
#   When set, also maps this hostname to host-gateway in the mastercontainer through Compose extra_hosts.
#   Present deployments copy that mapping to nextcloud-aio-* siblings listed in the docker_containers fact.
#   Its name-to-properties hash supplies each container's path under the default /var/lib/docker/containers/ root.
#   Each sibling gets a guarded exec after Compose that updates path + hosts in place as root on the Docker host.
#   Missing hosts files are skipped; newly created containers are covered by the next run's fact snapshot.
#   A failed or empty master lookup prevents the write and fails the exec. Only the master needs Docker exec and awk;
#   child containers need no shell or tools and may have a read-only root filesystem. The docker class supplies the
#   host tools. Docker owns the remaining hosts content; Puppet adds no management header or retirement cleanup.
#   Undef omits that mapping and leaves the application proxy to the deployment; a same-host HTTPS proxy is still
#   required.
#
# @param skeleton_directory
#   Global default skeleton directory written through OCC `config:system:set skeletondirectory`. The default is an
#   empty string, matching upstream AIO's own recommendation to disable the sample-content skeleton.
#
# @param smtp_from
#   Optional plain sender address, split into `mail_from_address` and `mail_domain`. Undef or empty leaves both keys
#   unmanaged so Nextcloud supplies its own sender. Display names are not supported.
#
# @param smtp_password
#   Optional Sensitive password written as mail_smtppassword. Undef or empty omits the key. Requires a nonempty
#   smtp_username; newlines are rejected without logging the password. No authentication method
#   is imposed. Commands, guards and output use the protection in docker::nextcloud_occ; credentials remain
#   visible to administrators who can inspect process arguments.
#
# @param smtp_port
#   Optional relay port written as integer `mail_smtpport`. Undef leaves it unmanaged; Nextcloud defaults to 25.
#
# @param smtp_security
#   Transport mode: none writes an empty mail_smtpsecure for automatic STARTTLS when the relay offers it; ssl
#   writes ssl for implicit TLS. Defaults to none. The tls mode is rejected because Nextcloud cannot enforce
#   STARTTLS. Selecting ssl does not change the port; supply the port required by your relay.
#
# @param smtp_server
#   Optional relay written as mail_smtphost. Undef or empty inherits a nonempty
#   basic_settings::smtp_server when that class is declared. A relay selects SMTP mode and manages transport and
#   authentication. Without a relay, mail settings remain unmanaged; additional SMTP options require a relay.
#
# @param smtp_timeout
#   Optional timeout in seconds written as integer `mail_smtptimeout`. Undef leaves it unmanaged;
#   Nextcloud defaults to 10.
#
# @param smtp_username
#   Optional user written as mail_smtpname. Undef or empty omits the key. Authentication requires both a nonempty
#   username and password. With a relay, mail_smtpauth is true for a complete pair and false without credentials.
#   Omitted credential keys are not written or deleted; existing values remain stored but unused.
#
# @param ssl_certificate
#   Public TLS certificate path for the generated Nginx vhosts; required when either public name is set.
#   One certificate is shared by both endpoints and must cover both names when both are published.
#
# @param ssl_certificate_key
#   Public TLS private key path; required when either public name is set.
#
# @param ssl_certificate_trusted
#   Optional trusted certificate path for public OCSP configuration.
#
# @param ssl_verify
#   Verifies only the admin upstream certificate. Defaults to false for AIO's self-signed admin certificate, even
#   after domain setup. True requires a matching proxy_ssl_name and proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate configured through
#   nginx http_directives. The application upstream uses HTTP and does not consume this setting.
#
# @param target
#   `basic_settings::systemd` target suffix that should bind to the generated Compose service. The default is
#   `services`.
#
# @api public
