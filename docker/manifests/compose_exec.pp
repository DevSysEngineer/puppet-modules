# @summary Runs a guarded command in a container belonging to a managed Compose deployment.
#
# Declare `docker` and the corresponding `docker::compose` stack, directly or through an application wrapper.
# This resource waits for that stack; it does not manage its files, start containers or allocate a terminal.
# Service discovery excludes one-off docker compose run containers and requires exactly one running match.
# For an application-managed sibling without Compose service labels, select its exact container_name instead.
# Docker exec fails for a missing or stopped container. Explicit container names are not checked against project
# labels; the caller must supply the name belonging to this deployment. Specify exactly one selection method.
# Commands and guards are marked Sensitive and output logging is disabled. Sensitive arguments are redacted in reports,
# but remain visible to anyone permitted to inspect host or container process arguments.
# Environment values are passed through Docker's command arguments and are visible to host/Docker administrators.
# For secrets that must stay out of arguments, use a protected stdin_file and read it inside the container.
#
# @example Initialize application data only when the container reports it is missing
#   docker::compose_exec { 'initialize-example':
#     command      => ['/usr/local/bin/app', 'initialize'],
#     compose_name => 'example',
#     service      => 'web',
#     unless       => ['/usr/local/bin/app', 'initialized'],
#   }
#
# @param command
#   Executable and arguments inside the container. Each array element is escaped separately; use /bin/sh -c explicitly
#   for shell code. Sensitive arguments remain protected while the command is assembled.
#
# @param compose_name
#   Title of the managed docker::compose resource. Also the project label when selecting by service.
#
# @param container_name
#   Exact Docker container name for application-managed siblings without Compose labels. Defaults to undef;
#   mutually exclusive with service. Container names are unique within the local Docker daemon.
#
# @param creates
#   Optional absolute host path checked by Puppet; an existing path skips execution. Default undef.
#
# @param environment
#   Container process environment shared by command, onlyif and unless, default empty. Use Sensitive values for
#   secrets in Puppet reports.
#
# @param onlyif
#   Optional read-only executable and arguments inside the container, accepting Sensitive[String]. Exit 0 allows
#   command; other exit codes skip it. Also runs during Puppet --noop. Default undef adds no prerequisite check.
#
# @param refreshonly
#   Defaults to false. True executes only on refresh events; creates, onlyif and unless still guard execution.
#
# @param service
#   Compose service label; exactly one running container must match. Defaults to undef; excludes container_name.
#
# @param stdin_file
#   Optional absolute host file read as stdin for command only, enabling docker exec -i. Manage its permissions and
#   dependency yourself.
#
# @param timeout
#   Maximum seconds for each command or guard, default 120. Timing out the Docker client may leave the container process
#   running.
#
# @param unless
#   Optional read-only executable and arguments inside the container. Exit 0 skips command; also runs during Puppet
#   --noop. Default undef.
#
# @param user
#   Optional container user or UID, optionally with a group, for command and both guards. Default undef uses the image
#   user. This does not change the host user connecting to Docker.
