# @summary Installs Docker and the shared Compose runtime and monitoring tools.
#
# This class installs Docker CE, Compose, shared exec and backup scripts, and shared Compose and S3 monitoring checks.
# S3 monitoring requires native curl SigV4 and GNU coreutils; HTTPS also needs curl >= 7.88 with the OpenSSL backend.
# All docker::compose* definitions require this parent class, including when retiring a project.
# Repository setup is expected to be handled separately, commonly through `basic_settings` with `docker_enable => true`.
#
# @example Install Docker CE
#   class { 'docker': }
#
# @param edition
#   Docker edition to install. The only supported value is `ce`, which installs the `docker-ce` package.
#
# @api public

  Enum['ce'] $edition = 'ce',
