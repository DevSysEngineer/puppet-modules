# @summary Deploys and monitors one Docker Compose project as a systemd service.
#
# This defined type creates a root-only project directory under `/opt/docker`, manages optional `.env` content and
# project-local directories, validates rendered Compose content or a file from an HTTPS, local file, or Puppet
# file-server source, and creates a `docker-compose-<title>.service` when the shared systemd wrapper is available.
# It also registers a stack-level monitoring check so container health can be evaluated separately from the
# orchestration unit.
# Declare `docker` before managing a project, including removal; the class owns all shared Compose tools.
#
# @example Deploy a Compose stack from a Puppet file source
#   docker::compose { 'example':
#     compose_source => 'puppet:///modules/profile/example/docker-compose.yml',
#   }
#
# @example Deploy a stack with sensitive environment content
#   docker::compose { 'example':
#     compose_source => 'file:///srv/puppet/example/docker-compose.yml',
#     env_content    => Sensitive("COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=example\n"),
#   }
#
# @param backup_database_on_calendar
#   Local-time systemd schedule, default daily at 05:00. Used only when backup_database_type is set.
#
# @param backup_database_retention_days
#   Positive retention in days, default 7. Cleanup follows a successful export and always retains that new backup.
#
# @param backup_database_type
#   Optional database action: undef disables it; postgresql exports the selected PostgreSQL database and globals.
#   Requires basic_settings::systemd and backup_service. Credentials and database identity come from the running
#   container.
#
# @param backup_service
#   Compose service name to back up, not a container name. Defaults to undef; required for a present stack with
#   backup_database_type set. The service must have exactly one running container. Unused when backups are disabled.
#   PostgreSQL must listen on container-local TCP port 5432 with password authentication. The container needs sh,
#   cat, date, mkdir, rmdir, pg_dump, pg_dumpall and timeout. External databases are not supported.
#   The database comes from POSTGRES_DB, falling back to POSTGRES_USER and then postgres; the user comes from
#   POSTGRES_USER or postgres. Supply a nonempty password through either POSTGRES_PASSWORD or POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE,
#   not both. POSTGRES_USER_FILE, POSTGRES_DB_FILE and POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust are not supported.
#   The export contains cluster globals followed by the selected database with all schemas and CREATE DATABASE.
#   Application connection settings are not checked; ensure the selected database is the one the application uses.
#   Initialization variables do not update existing database contents or roles; apply identity and password changes
#   to PostgreSQL itself as well.
#
# @param compose_checksum
#   Optional SHA256 checksum for compose_source, unavailable with compose_content. This is most useful for HTTPS sources
#   where unexpected upstream changes should fail the Puppet run.
#
# @param compose_content
#   Optional rendered Compose content, default undef. Supply exactly one of compose_content and compose_source for a
#   present stack.
#
# @param compose_source
#   Optional Compose file source, default undef. Must start with `https://`, `file:///`, or `puppet:///`; excludes
#   compose_content.
#
# @param compose_stop_action
#   Compose action after stop_pre_commands. Defaults to down, which runs `down --remove-orphans`; stop retains
#   containers and networks by running `stop`. Used only by the generated systemd service.
#
# @param ensure
#   Defaults to present. Absent deletes the entire project directory, including database backups and project-local
#   bind-mount data. Copy required data elsewhere and stop and disable the backup timer and service before removal.
#   It does not stop application containers. Central directory management owns undeclared systemd files;
#   Docker named volumes remain. Back up required data, stop the stack and reload systemd when retiring its units.
#
# @param env_content
#   Optional `.env` file content. Strings are wrapped in `Sensitive`; explicit `Sensitive[String]` values are passed
#   through.
#
# @param env_source
#   Optional Puppet-compatible source for the `.env` file. When set, it takes precedence over `env_content` and must
#   start with `https://`, `file:///`, or `puppet:///`.
#
# @param monitoring_detail_limit
#   Optional diagnostic character limit. `undef` omits -l and uses the environment value or script default.
#
# @param monitoring_expected_exited
#   Container names that are allowed to be exited without making the stack critical, such as one-shot migration
#   containers.
#
# @param monitoring_health_required
#   Container names that must have a healthy Docker health state.
#
# @param monitoring_interval
#   Monitoring interval in seconds for the Compose stack check.
#
# @param monitoring_orphan_critical
#   Optional orphan severity. True passes -O, false passes -o; undef uses the environment value or script default.
#
# @param monitoring_profiles
#   Compose profiles passed to the monitoring check.
#
# @param monitoring_starting_grace
#   Optional startup grace in seconds. `undef` omits -g and uses the environment value or script default.
#
# @param monitoring_timeout
#   Timeout in seconds for the Compose stack monitoring check.
#
# @param project_directories
#   Optional single-segment directories created below the Compose project directory before the systemd service starts.
#   Values may override owner, group, and mode. Only the directory entry is managed; contents remain unmanaged.
#   With database backups enabled, backup is reserved with root:root ownership and mode 0700, overriding caller values.
#
# @param pull
#   Image pull policy passed to `docker compose up --pull` for every service in the stack. Defaults to `missing`:
#   downloads images absent from the local cache and also refreshes latest tags. `always` pulls the configured image
#   tags on each Compose service start. With `never`, images must be available locally or startup fails.
#   The CLI policy overrides pull_policy in the Compose file. Pull failures fail startup; there is no periodic update.
#   Changing this parameter reloads the systemd unit; an already active stack uses it on its next service start.
#
# @param start_post_commands
#   Ordered systemd ExecStartPost command lines after Compose starts. Defaults to [], omitting ExecStartPost.
#   Each command must be nonempty and single-line, using systemd command syntax without an implicit shell.
#   Commands run as root under the Compose service's hardening and timeouts. Callers must supply and order any
#   extra executables or files before the stack. Do not include secrets: the unit is publicly readable.
#
# @param stop_pre_commands
#   Ordered systemd ExecStop command lines before the Compose stop action. Defaults to [], adding no commands.
#   Uses the same syntax, execution context and prerequisite contract as start_post_commands. A command failure
#   skips the remaining ExecStop commands, including Compose; failures are not ignored.
#
# @param target
#   `basic_settings::systemd` target suffix that should bind to the generated Compose service. The default is
#   `services`.
#
