# @summary Adds one managed host record to `/etc/hosts`.
#
# This defined type appends a single idempotent concat fragment to the hosts file owned by `basic_settings::hosts`.
# The fragment title is based on the IP address and host name so duplicate records surface as duplicate Puppet resources instead of producing repeated lines in `/etc/hosts`.
#
# @example Add the Puppet server to `/etc/hosts`
#   basic_settings::hosts_entry { 'puppet':
#     ip       => '10.200.3.69',
#     hostname => 'puppet',
#   }
#
# @param hostname
#   Hostname or fully qualified domain name written after the IP address.
#
# @param ip
#   IPv4 or IPv6 address written for the host record.
#
# @param comment
#   Comment written above the host record. `undef` uses the resource title.
#
# @param ensure
#   Controls whether the concat fragment is emitted.
#
# @param order
#   Concat fragment order. The default places entries after the standard localhost and IPv6 fragments.
