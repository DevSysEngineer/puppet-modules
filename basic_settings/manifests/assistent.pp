# @summary Manages console assistant packages and local keyboard configuration.
#
# This class removes desktop assistant packages that are not useful on hardened servers, optionally installs audio
# support, and manages `/etc/default/keyboard` and `/etc/default/console-setup`. It also manages keyboard debconf
# answers when `Package['debconf']` has already been declared. Keyboard configuration is enabled by default on physical
# hosts and disabled by default on virtual machines unless explicitly overridden.
#
# @example Use the default server-oriented assistant settings
#   include basic_settings::assistent
#
# @example Enable keyboard package and configuration management on a virtual machine
#   class { 'basic_settings::assistent':
#     keyboard_enable => true,
#   }
#
# @param audio_enable
#   Installs PipeWire audio packages when `true`; purges them when `false`.
#   The default is `false` because most managed servers do not need audio.
#
# @param keyboard_codeset
#   Console codeset identifier written to the console setup template. The default is `Lat15`.
#
# @param keyboard_enable
#   Controls installation of console-setup and keyboard-configuration and management of their debconf answers and
#   configuration.
#   `undef` uses the host type default, `true` forces management on, and `false` purges the keyboard packages and
#   `/etc/console-setup`.
#   Debconf answers are managed only when `Package['debconf']` is already declared; packages and files are managed
#   independently.
#   Does not declare a keyboard reload or console service restart for configuration changes.
#
# @param keyboard_layout
#   XKB layout or comma-separated layouts written to debconf and `/etc/default/keyboard`. The default is `us`.
